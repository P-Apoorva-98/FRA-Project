Context
In the realm of modern finance, businesses encounter the perpetual challenge of managing debt obligations effectively to maintain a favorable credit standing and foster sustainable growth. Investors keenly scrutinize companies capable of navigating financial complexities while ensuring stability and profitability. A pivotal instrument in this evaluation process is the balance sheet, which provides a comprehensive overview of a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity, offering insights into its financial health and operational efficiency. In this context, leveraging available financial data, particularly from preceding fiscal periods, becomes imperative for informed decision-making and strategic planning.

With the help of the tool, it endeavors to empower businesses and investors with a robust mechanism for evaluating the financial well-being and creditworthiness of companies. By harnessing machine learning techniques, the organization aims to analyze historical financial statements and extract pertinent insights to facilitate informed decision-making via the tool. Specifically, the organization foresees facilitating the following with the help of the tool:

Debt Management Analysis: Identify patterns and trends in debt management practices to assess the ability of businesses to fulfill financial obligations promptly and efficiently, and identify potential cases of default.
Credit Risk Evaluation: Evaluate credit risk exposure by analyzing liquidity ratios, debt-to-equity ratios, and other key financial indicators to ascertain the likelihood of default and inform investment decisions.
As a part of the data science team in the organization, you have been provided with the financial metrics of different companies. The task is to analyze the data provided and develop a predictive model leveraging machine learning techniques to identify whether a given company will default on its debt repayments in the next two quarters. The predictive model will help the organization anticipate potential challenges with the financial performance of the companies and enable proactive risk mitigation strategies.
